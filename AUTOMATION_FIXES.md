# Automation Engine Fixes - October 27, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Automation Not Running Automatically

**Problem**: Automation engine only ran when clicking refresh button, not on interval.

**Root Cause**: The `useEffect` hook was including `runAutomation` function in its dependency closure without memoization, causing intervals to be cleared and recreated constantly.

**Solution**:

- Split the effect into two separate effects: one for initial status fetch, one for automation intervals
- Added explicit interval cleanup at the start of the effect to prevent stacking
- Added console logs to track automation cycles
- Dependencies now only `[isRunning, intervalSeconds]` which are stable values

**Files Modified**:

- `components/AutomationStatusIndicator.tsx`

**Result**: Automation now runs automatically every X seconds (configurable 10-300s) without manual intervention.

---

### 2. ✅ Sleep Delays Causing Errors

**Problem**: `await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))` delays were causing issues.

**Solution**: Removed all sleep/delay code from:

- Welcome messages loop
- Referrer alerts loop
- Event reminders loop

**Files Modified**:

- `app/api/cron/automation/route.ts`

**Result**: Automation runs faster without artificial delays that could cause timeouts.

---

### 3. ✅ Generic Error Messages (HTTP 500)

**Problem**: Error messages just showed "HTTP 500" without details from DripSender API.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced error handling to parse DripSender API response body
- Extract detailed error messages: `HTTP 500: {message from API}`
- Store detailed errors in `notifications_log`

**Files Modified**:

- `lib/whatsapp.ts`

**Result**: Detailed error messages now visible in notifications log showing exact reason for failures.

---

### 4. ✅ No Pending Status for New Registrations

**Problem**: New participant registrations didn't create pending notification logs.

**Solution**:

- After creating participant, immediately create `notifications_log` entry with:
  - `status: "pending"`
  - `type: "welcome"`
  - `metadata: participantData` (for retry functionality)
  - Automation will pick these up and process them

**Files Modified**:

- `app/api/register/route.ts`

**Result**: New registrations now show as "Pending" in notifications log, waiting for automation to process.

---

### 5. ✅ No Retry Functionality for Failed Messages

**Problem**: If a message failed to send, there was no way to retry it.

**Solution**:

- Created new API endpoint: `POST /api/notifications/retry`
- Endpoint accepts `notificationId`, fetches original notification data, and retries sending
- Uses metadata stored in notification log to reconstruct message variables
- Creates new log entry with updated status

**New Files**:

- `app/api/notifications/retry/route.ts`

**Files Modified**:

- `app/admin/notifications/page.tsx` - Added retry button UI

**Result**: Failed notifications now have a retry button (↻ icon) that resends the message.

---

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Notifications UI

**Improvements**:

- Added "Pending" status badge (yellow, animated spinner)
- Added "Pending" count to stats cards
- Added retry button for failed messages (blue ↻ icon)
- Shows loading spinner while retrying
- Updated status filter to include "Pending" option
- Better error display with detailed messages

**Files Modified**:

- `app/admin/notifications/page.tsx`

## How It Works Now

### Automation Flow:

```
1. User registers → Creates participant + pending notification log
2. Automation runs every X seconds (auto-start when admin opens)
3. Checks for pending/unsent notifications
4. Sends messages via DripSender API
5. Updates notification log: pending → success/failed
6. Detailed errors stored if failed
7. Admin can retry failed messages
```

### User Experience:

- ✅ Admin opens any page → Automation starts automatically
- ✅ Automation runs in background every X seconds
- ✅ Live countdown shows "Next check in: 57s, 56s, 55s..."
- ✅ No need to click refresh
- ✅ New registrations create pending notifications
- ✅ Failed messages show detailed errors
- ✅ One-click retry for failed messages
- ✅ Pending messages shown with spinner

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test Automation Interval:

1. Open admin panel (any page)
2. Click automation icon in header
3. Verify "● Running" status
4. Watch countdown: should decrease every second (60, 59, 58...)
5. When countdown hits 0, automation should run automatically
6. Check browser console for: `[Automation] Running automation cycle...`
7. Verify countdown resets and continues

### Test Pending Notifications:

1. Go to landing page
2. Register a new participant
3. Go to `/admin/notifications`
4. Should see new entry with "Pending" status (yellow badge, spinner)
5. Wait for automation interval (or click refresh in automation popup)
6. Notification should change to "Success" (green) or "Failed" (red)

### Test Retry Functionality:

1. Find a failed notification in `/admin/notifications`
2. Click the blue retry button (↻ icon)
3. Button shows spinner while processing
4. On success: Alert "Message resent successfully!" + new log entry created
5. On failure: Alert shows detailed error message
6. List refreshes automatically after retry

### Test Detailed Errors:

1. Configure invalid DripSender API key in settings
2. Let automation run or manually trigger
3. Go to `/admin/notifications`
4. Click eye icon on failed notification
5. Should see detailed error like: "HTTP 401: Invalid API key"

---

## Configuration

### Automation Interval:

- Go to `/admin/settings` → Automation tab
- Set "Automation Engine Interval" (10-300 seconds)
- Saves to Firebase: `automation_settings/config`
- Automation restarts with new interval

### API Keys:

- Go to `/admin/settings` → DripSender API Keys tab
- Add at least one active API key
- System rotates keys automatically on failure

---

## Monitoring

### Check Automation Status:

- Click automation icon in header
- Shows:
  - Running/Stopped status
  - Interval setting
  - Countdown to next run
  - Last run results (welcome/referrer/events counts)
  - Processing indicator
  - Errors if any

### Check Notification Logs:

- Go to `/admin/notifications`
- Filter by:
  - Type (welcome, referrer_alert, event_reminder)
  - Status (success, failed, pending)
  - Date range
- Click eye icon for details
- Click retry button for failed messages

---

## Files Changed Summary

### Modified:

1. `components/AutomationStatusIndicator.tsx` - Fixed interval triggering
2. `app/api/cron/automation/route.ts` - Removed sleep delays
3. `lib/whatsapp.ts` - Enhanced error handling
4. `app/api/register/route.ts` - Create pending notification logs
5. `app/admin/notifications/page.tsx` - Added retry UI, pending status

### Created:

---

## Database Schema Updates

### notifications_log Collection:

```typescript
{
  participant_id: string,
  target_phone: string,
  type: "welcome" | "referrer_alert" | "event_reminder" | "broadcast",
  status: "pending" | "success" | "failed",  // Added "pending"
  message_content: string | null,
  error: string | null,  // Now contains detailed errors
  api_key_used: string | null,
  metadata: object,  // Added for retry functionality
  event_id: string | null,
  created_at: string
}
```
